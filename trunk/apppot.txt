This document describes how to set up and use an AppPot system image.
In particular, it embeds all the relevant scripts using [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/][Emacs'
Org-babel mode]].  You can still read and edit this document using
any regular text editor, but you will need to copy+paste the
scripts out of it yourself.

* Introduction 

AppPot is a way to implement generic application deployment on a
computational Grid, and especially to enable users to provide their
own software to the computing cluster.

AppPot uses [[http://user-mode-linux.sf.net][User Mode Linux]] to provide users with a development and
running environment they have full control over.  User Mode Linux (UML
for short) provides a virtualized environment in which users can build
and run their own computational applications. AppPot augments this
with scripts that can take a copy of the UML system image and submit
it as a regular computational job using the ARC middleware.

** What is User Mode Linux

User-Mode Linux allows running a Linux kernel as a userspace process
within a running Linux system; the guest kernel can see a file in the
host filesystem as if it was a disk device, but it can also mount
(portions of) the host filesystem into its own filesystem
hierarchy. Additional helper programs enable use of the host network
from within the system running in the UML.

From the [[http://user-mode-linux.sf.net][UML website]]:

  User-Mode Linux gives you a virtual machine that may have more
  hardware and software virtual resources than your actual, physical
  computer. Disk storage for the virtual machine is entirely contained
  inside a single file on your physical machine. You can assign your
  virtual machine only the hardware access you want it to have. With
  properly limited access, nothing you do on the virtual machine can
  change or damage your real computer, or its software. 

These are all features that are now familiar in virtualization
products; the main difference of UML with respect to other
virtualization solutions is that:
  - User-Mode Linux can only run Linux inside Linux.
  - [[http://user-mode-linux.sf.net][*User Mode Linux]] runs entirely in userspace* (including networking),
    so there is no need for support by the systems administrator, nor
    is any coordinated deployment or setup needed.
  - UML's use of system resources is more easily controlled: a running
    UML system is just a process in the host Linux system, so all
    regular process controls apply.

** How is UML useful for running computational jobs on a Grid

Users receive a "AppPot system image", which is a raw Linux disk image
containing a working installation of Debian Linux.  Apart from being
optimized for running a single-user task in a virtualized environment
(i.e., multi-user support, hardware-related software and most daemons
have been turned off), this is a regular Debian install.

Users modify the AppPot system image by installing new software, e.g.,
their own version of a computational code.  They can then submit a
job to the Grid middleware that just runs UML with the provided modified image.
A script is provided to create the correct incantation to run the
AppPot system remotely as a Grid computational job, and have it
execute a copy of the user's code with the specified parameters.
In order to reduce the network traffic, if the AppPot image is already
installed at the execution site, the script can just send a tarball
with the differences between the standard AppPot and the user-modified one.

This solves the issue of compiling and deploying each application
software on each architecture: users compile and run tests on
their own desktop.  There's no worry about multiple architecture/OSes
because all jobs run in the same Debian environment: same environment
for development and execution.

The AppPot system image is accompanied by the helper programs `linux`
and `slirp`; these are just statically-linked versions of the binaries
provided by Debian and can be used by anyone for running a UML system
in their Linux-based desktop (static link guarantees wider
compatibility).  

Note that, since the AppPot system image is a raw disk image file, it
can be run through any virtualization software that supports the RAW
disk format (e.g., KVM or Xen): this provides a way to use the AppPot
system in a more convenient way for users.


* Creation of the AppPot system image

Although any Linux system can run with a UML kernel, most Linux
distributions ship with configuration that are oriented towards
Desktop/graphical or server/multi-user usage.  Those systems are
definitely overkill for a UML system whose sole purpose is to run a
single instance of a computational job.  

On the other hand, the AppPot image needs to be usable by end-users
for compiling, installing and testing applications, so a good choice
of development tools must be available on it.

The ideal choice for the AppPot system image seems to be Debian
distribution:
  - A *bare bones* system setup is supported by the installation
    script (in the minimal setup, only three processes are running
    after system boot, including `/sbin/init`; the total size of
    installed packages is ~200MB) -- this can be even reduced by
    carefully disabling some features that are not needed in the
    AppPot environment.
  - It has a *vast selection of pre-compiled packages*, that users can
    easily install with `apt-get`/`aptitude`.  The choice of available
    development tools is probably the largest among Linux
    distributions.
  - It comes with excellent UML support, including:
    * pre-packaged UML kernel, matching the distribution's default
      kernel version;
    * tools to bootstrap a UML disk image;
    * utilities for UML networking.

** Installation of UML in the host computer

UML runs a modified Linux kernel as a regular process.  A sample
kernel (Fedora's linux-2.6.24-x86_64) and root image can be downloaded
from the [[http://user-mode-linux.sf.net][UML website]].  

Debian/Ubuntu provide a pre-compiled UML kernel in package
`user-mode-linux`.  In addition, Debian (hence, Ubuntu) provides
packages for creating a UML disk image (rootstrap) and for userspace
UML networking (slirp, vde).

The instructions are intended to be performed on a Debian/Ubuntu
system; the following software should be installed as a prerequisite:
  - a User-Mode Linux kernel;
  - the `slirp` program (compiled with `-DFULL_BOLT` to remove speed restrictions);
  - the `rootstrap` program to install Debian images.
The following command installs prerequisite software on a
Debian/Ubuntu system:
#+begin_src sh :exports code :file install-prereq.sh :shebang "#!/bin/sh"
sudo aptitude install \
  user-mode-linux \
  slirp \
  rootstrap
#+end_src

** The AppPot Debian image

The AppPot Debian image is a regular Debian GNU/Linux installation,
with the following features:
  - The same image is used by users for code development and testing
    and for running a production job remotely.
  - It provides a single-user environment, where multi-user features are
    disabled to save space and execution time.

In particular, this translates into the following requirements:
  - There is just one unprivileged user in `/etc/passwd`, and this
    user is entitled to run `root` commands via `sudo` (Grid users
    must be able to install additional packages if they are needed
    for code development and/or run time).  In particular, no strong
    security system (like [[SELinux]]) is needed, and all supporting
    code can be removed from the system and its kernel.
  - Upon booting, the user is dropped directly to a shell prompt;
    there is no need for `/bin/login`.  There is just one terminal,
    multiplexed with [[GNU Screen]].
  - Network access is only *outbound*: users have access to the
    system console, and jobs are not usually able to receive
    incoming network traffic at execution sites.  Network daemons
    can thus be removed to save space.
  - In order to run jobs, it should be possible to specify a program
    to run (with arguments) on the kernel command line; the should
    execute the specified program non-interactively instead of the
    shell prompt.

Debian's program [[rootstrap]] will be used for creating the AppPot
image.  The `rootstrap` command reads its configuration from the
system-wide file `/etc/rootstrap/rootstrap.conf` and merges it with
a `rootstrap.conf` file in the current directory (if it exists).
The format of the configuration file is documented in the
[[http://manpages.ubuntu.com/1/rootstrap][rootstrap(1)]] man page.

Based on the previous items, AppPot's `rootstrap.conf` builds a Debian
system image as follows:
  - 1GB disk space: this should be enough for hosting all the software
    one can possibly want to install for development; the actual
    working/scratch space will always be mounted from the host system.
  - Use the ext2 filesystem: journaling features provide no advantage
    here, as the whole disk is just a file in the host filesystem, and
    the small size of the disk image, combined with its interactive
    nature make an initial filesystem check just a nuisance.
#+begin_src sh :tangle rootstrap.conf
[global]
# Initial size of the filesystem image (in MBs). It will be created
# sparsely, so additional space is not allocated until it is used.
initialsize=1024
# the filesystem to create
fstype=ext2
# add the `appot` module to the std list to perform local customization
modules=network mkfs mount debian uml apppot umount
# rootstraps' defaults are too low for installing squeeze
umlargs= mem=256M
#+end_src

Network settings in rootstrap only apply to the initial image setup;
however, having production settings here saves us from changing them
later on.  We use the `slirp-fullbolt` program to provide access through
the user's networking capabilities on the host; we assume that
`slirp`'s default network 10.0.2.x does not conflict with local IP
installations. 
#+begin_src sh :tangle rootstrap.conf
[network]
# name of the network interface inside the UML
interface=eth0
transport=slirp
# note: the following settings were copied verbatim from
# /etc/rootstrap/rootstrap.conf; they're slirp's defaults, tho
host=
uml=10.0.2.15
nameserver=10.0.2.3
gateway=10.0.2.2
netmask=255.255.0.0
slirp=slirp-fullbolt
#+end_src

Debian's testing distribution provides a good compromise of stability
and up-to-date packages.  
#+begin_src sh :tangle rootstrap.conf
[debian]
dist=squeeze
mirror=http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/debian/

# Sources for target's sources list. If no value is given the default
# is to use the main section of $mirror
# NOTE: you can provide multiple lines if each new line is indented
# with blank spaces
sources=
  deb http://security.debian.org/ testing/updates main contrib non-free
  deb http://mirror.switch.ch/ftp/mirror/debian/ testing main contrib non-free

#+end_src

The default system-wide `/etc/rootstrap/rootstrap.conf` excludes
packages `pcmcia-cs` and `setserial` from the start, but this makes
the installation fail.  Let us override this here: we'll remove unused
packages later on.
#+begin_src sh :tangle rootstrap.conf
# Packages which should not be installed in the first place (be sure
# you know what you're doing)
exclude=

#+end_src

After the base system is installed, `rootstrap` invokes `apt-get` to
remove and then install packages as specified in the following
configuration lines.  Note that we just install the package `apppot`:
its dependencies control what really gets installed (but this allows
us to override some configuration files as well).
#+begin_src sh :tangle rootstrap.conf
# Packages which should be purged after the initial install
purge=dmidecode isc-dhcp-client isc-dhcp-common tasksel tasksel-data
  
# Extra packages to install via apt after initial debootstrap install
install=makedev bash screen

#+end_src

Image customization is performed by a custom `apppot` module, which is
run from `rootstrap`.  According to [[man:rootstrap][rootstrap(1)]]:

  When a module is invoked, the filesystem being created is mounted on
  $TARGET, `/dev`, `/etc` and `/tmp` are tmpfs filesystems internal to
  the UML system, while the root filesystem is a hostfs mount of the
  system where rootstrap is running, to have access to the above
  shadowed directories the full host filesystem is available on
  $HOST. `/lib/modules` is tmpfs too and bind mounted to the host's
  `/usr/lib/uml/modules` to let scripts load necessary kernel modules.
  This means that most software on the host system should be available
  and work as expected.  The working directory where rootstrap is run
  is available as $WORKDIR. The environment is generated from the
  configuration file as described above.

Local modules should be placed in the `modules/` directory and
implement the following interface

The following actions are performed by the `apppot` module:

*** Reset the `root` password to a known standard value

Since there are no security concerns, we can just use a passwordless
root account:
#+begin_src sh :tangle modules/apppot :shebang #!/bin/sh
# remove root password
chroot $TARGET passwd -d root
#+end_src

*** Modify `/etc/inittab` so that a root shell is started on the system console

#+begin_src sh :tangle modules/apppot
cat >> $TARGET/etc/inittab <<__EOF__
# spawn a root shell on the system console...
0:2345:respawn:/usr/bin/screen /bin/bash
__EOF__
# ...and comment out the console getty instances
sed -i -e 's|^\([1-6]\):|#\1:|' /etc/inittab
#+end_src


*** Install additional packages

This is made trivial with `apt-get` and `aptitude`:
#+begin_src sh :export code :file modules/apppot :tangle modules/apppot
# install additional packages
chroot $TARGET aptitude -y install \
  bash jed less screen sudo subversion git-core \
  autoconf automake libtool make \
  gcc-4.4 g++-4.4 libc6-dev libstdc++6-4.4-dev \
  ;
  
#+end_src


** The `apppot` Debian package

Customization of the AppPot system image is done automatically by
installing a single Debian package `apppot`.  Since the package is
versioned, one has a simple way to check what exact features are
provided by a certain AppPot image by looking at the version number.
In addition, existing images can be upgraded by upgrading the `apppot`
package.

The `apppot` package is a regular Debian package; it depends on all
extra packages (i.e., not in the Debian base system) that AppPot
includes, and replaces some configuration files with customized
versions.

The `apppot` package is described by the single file
`debian/packages`, which follows the format required by the [[http://yada.alioth.debian.org/][Yada]] tool.

#+begin_src sh :tangle debian/packages
## This is adapted from the example packages file for YADA; read
## /usr/share/doc/yada-doc/yada.txt.gz (from the yada-doc package) to
## find out how to customise it to your needs.

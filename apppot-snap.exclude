# apppot-snap.exclude
#
# List here glob patterns of files to exclude from a AppPot snapshot.
# For a file to be excluded, a pattern must match its name from the
# start up to (and excluding) a '/' character.  File names are not
# normalized, instead they should match exactly as 'tar' sees them,
# therefore use a leading './' because 'tar' is asked to archive
# directory '.' in the system root directory.
#
# *Note:* The AppPot scripts are excluded, because they are both running
# when the merge operation happens at boot time: changing the text in
# a script while the shell is executing it is an almost sure recipe for
# getting syntax errors.
